	A business is always affected by an external force. Technology is one of them. New technological devices are invented and produced all of the time. This can majority affect a business if they do not plan ahead. In the old days, there were messengers who traveled across the globe to deliver messages. They were making a lining by doing this. Then, the telegram was invented and made communication between countries very easy and fast. This greatly affected the messengers as they were placed out of a job. In order for a business to be successful, it must, at all times, keep up-to-date with the most recent technological trends. Square has to keep in mind the technological factors that can run them out of business. A smartphone company may place a credit card reader inside their phone. This will will force Square to adapt in order to thrive. They must come up with a unique idea that will stump their competitors.
	Competitive environment is another external factor that heavily affects a business.   Square has multiple competitors that forces them to make their products better than their’s. CloverGo and PayPal Here are two of the very popular competitors. Both of these companies have advantages and disadvantages over Square. CloverGo offers the merchants better account management compared to what Square offers. This means a merchant’s account will be more stable and freezing of accounts will be greatly reduced. Fortunately for Square, that kind of service from CloverGo comes at a price. They charge a recurring monthly fee and a fee to use there mobile application. Alternatively, PayPal Here is another Square competitor that offers many advantages. It offers the same services as Square, with lower fees. Unfortunately for Square, PayPal Here does not have any known disadvantages and that can drastically impact their business. A competitive environment is always a difficult challenge for any business, as it forces them to adapt to their competitors. 

	Global environment requires a business to carefully plan their marketing strategies. They have to comply with the polices of the territory or territories they are operating in. The political system varies nation by nation and a business must be aware of each of the countries’ system they are practicing there marketing strategies in. Tariffs are also something a business has to keep in mind when importing there goods. Square currently operates in  the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom. They have to be aware of all of the the political policies of each of these nations. Some nations may have a regulation that every business has to get certified for for public safety. For example, the FCC in the US and the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in the EU. This means that hardware approved in one nation, is not approved in another. In order for Square to be successful, they have to communicate with all of the headquarters in all of the nations it is operating in. Communication is extremely important and defines a good, successful business.
